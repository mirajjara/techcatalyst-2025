Why I chose this picture: I was invited to speak as a panelist at a networking/professional development event. I was sharing experience and giving advice to hundreds of people, something I've never done before at such a scale. I was pretty nervous.

 

Early career goals: I want to soak up as much knowledge for the next few years. Learn the industry and the advancements in technology as it comes. I want to own my work and try my hardest for my team and for the company.

 

Experience: In undergrad, I was a research assistant doing work in deep learning and breast cancer. I published a paper in my research as the primary author which was a huge feat for me. I also worked at a supermarket for 5 years which definitely improved my soft skills and customer service skills.

 

Fun Fact: There was a terrible flood last year that hit the supermarket I worked at. It left dozens of people (including me) trapped overnight. I'm also learning to speak Arabic.

 

Life goals: I want to become my own boss later in my career and I'm really interested in making and providing my own solutions.
